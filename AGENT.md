# AGENT.md — Budget Buddy

Operating manual for AI agents working in this repository. Read this before making
changes.

## What this project is

Budget Buddy is a small Python budget tracker used for GitHub Copilot (GH-300)
demonstrations. It is intentionally a **working but immature** app: the happy
path runs, starter tests pass, coverage is low, and realistic TODOs, bugs,
security gaps, and performance issues are left in place as teaching material.

Do not remove the intentional issues unless the user explicitly asks to move
toward the completed/reference state. If you fix one, update
[INTENTIONAL_ISSUES.md](INTENTIONAL_ISSUES.md) and [DEMO_SCRIPT.md](DEMO_SCRIPT.md).

## Environment and commands

```powershell
.\setup_demo.ps1                 # create venv and install deps
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1     # activate the environment
python main.py                   # run the app
pytest                           # run tests with coverage gate
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing
```

The coverage gate lives in [pytest.ini](pytest.ini). It starts at 30 and is
raised to 90 during the unit-test demo.

## Conventions

- Python only. Use pytest for tests.
- Use `logger` from [logger.py](logger.py) for app output, not `print`.
- Add type hints on public functions.
- Prefer small, readable functions.
- Update [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for meaningful changes.

## Agent workflow expectations

1. Add or update tests first when practical.
2. Fix the narrowest relevant code path.
3. Run `pytest`.
4. Update docs and changelog when behavior changes.
5. Summarize the result and remaining risks.
